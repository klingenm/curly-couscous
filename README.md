## Dev setup

- Requires npm 7+

Run `npm install` in the root directory, then `npm run start -w backend` to get a live dev server up and running locally.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the page. Everything is compiled live, but hot-module-reloading is not turned on, so you need to refresh the browser to get updated frontend changes.
